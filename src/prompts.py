Core Systems and Tools
We utilize a suite of systems to manage our business processes. Understanding these is key to your role.
•
Salesforce: This is Ideagen's primary CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system and the system of record for business development, sales, and account management data. It is used by 665 active users and is central to managing accounts, contacts, opportunities, and quotes. We use Single Sign-On (SSO) for access. There are multiple Salesforce orgs: Production (for live operations), FCS, QA, and Dev (used for development and testing). An old org exists for reference.
◦
Accounts: Represent customer organizations. Generally, accounts should not be deleted or modified on user request; merges require verification (no subscriptions) and approval from Matt Southgate.
◦
Contacts: Represent individuals at customer accounts. Like accounts, contacts should not be deleted or modified on user request; this should be done via Matt Southgate. Contacts are crucial for creating opportunities and linking activities.
◦
Opportunities: Represent potential sales deals. Opportunities track the progress of a sale through various stages (sales pipeline). They are linked to accounts and contacts. Opportunities should not be deleted unless they are Closed Won; others need review from Ed Sharp. There is an approval process for re-opening closed opportunities. Known errors related to opportunities include submission failures (approver not defined, missing PS product, sum of PS days set to 0, submitter role issue), locking due to compliance issues (handled by the compliance team), and data loading errors. Various ABC (Annual Bookable Contract) values (SaaS, Success, Support, Hosted, Perpetual, Recurring Delivery, One-Time Delivery) and total delivery/overall ABC values are calculated for opportunities, often using Rollup Helper.
◦
Products: Represent the software licenses, implementation services, and other offerings we sell. Product queries should be directed to Carl Hattersley.
◦
Quotes: Created from opportunities to provide pricing and details to customers. Quotes require specific information and often go through an approval process before being sent to the customer. Quote queries should be run past Ed Sharp.
◦
Reports: Salesforce allows users to create reports to analyze data, such as upcoming renewals or active subscriptions. Reports can be filtered, grouped, and customized by adding relevant fields.
•
Zuora: This is our subscription billing and revenue management system. Quotes are sent from Salesforce to Zuora by the SOP team once an opportunity is Closed Won or amended, which activates customer subscriptions and triggers invoicing. Zuora stores address data in Address1 and Address 2 fields, which needs to be combined into a single MailingStreet field in Salesforce with carriage return/line feed characters during data loading. Zuora requires contacts (Bill to and Sold to) to match Salesforce data for direct mapping. Migration tasks involve setting up legal entities, invoice/credit memo templates, and sequence sets in Zuora.
•
SalesLoft: Previously used as a business development platform for prospecting and running multi-touch campaigns (LinkedIn, email, phone calls). It integrates with Salesforce to push activity data. Damstra previously used SalesLoft, but the company is migrating to Outreach.
•
Outreach: This is the target sales execution platform that is replacing SalesLoft for business development activities like prospecting and campaign management. It integrates with Salesforce. Users previously using SalesLoft have found Outreach similar and easy to pick up. User setup involves adding users to an SSO group (azSecSSO_Outreach) and then unlocking them within Outreach admin, rather than adding directly.
•
ZoomInfo: A B2B database providing company and contact information used for finding target accounts and contacts. It is managed by Matt Southgate and Ed Sharp. ZoomInfo data (accounts, contacts) is pulled into Salesforce and used in prospecting platforms like SalesLoft/Outreach. We track specific "intent topics" in ZoomInfo to identify companies actively researching solutions we offer. Migrating acquired entities' ZoomInfo usage requires ensuring we purchase their existing intent topics to avoid losing functionality. Damstra tracks 12 intent topics and previously used 11 daily.
•
Clari: A system used to highlight opportunities that require attention, such as those not recently updated or stalled in a stage for too long. It is intended to drive good behavior in the sales team. Access issues have been seen if a user's Salesforce record does not have an @ideagen.com email address matching their Azure principle name. Meetings are logged in Clari based on contact domains associated with the account.
•
Jira: Used for project management and development management. The Business Analyst team uses a BA Jira board to manage priorities, tasks in progress, and upcoming tasks. Jira tickets are referenced in deployment commit messages.
•
Lucid: Used for process documentation.
•
SharePoint: Used for file storage. Centralized trackers, such as for pending invoice uploads and portal setups for Credit Control, are kept here.
•
Teams / Outlook: Primary tools for communication (messaging, email, meetings). Teams is used for quick questions or calls. Specific meetings with stakeholders should be booked with an agenda.
•
Gainsight: The platform used by the customer success team to monitor usage, licenses, etc., across Ideagen products. Certain users (e.g., customer-facing roles) can get access to a Gainsight plugin in Salesforce (the "Account Widget") to view this information on the account page. Granting access requires confirmation from Norman Hidalgo and Adam Perkins, allocating a license in Gainsight, and assigning specific permission sets in Salesforce (Gainsight NXT, Gainsight Account Component).
•
Asana: Project management tool, used by Marketing. Requests for Asana should go to Marketing.
•
SalesScreen: Used to display information to end users, integrating with Salesforce.
•
Consensus: Used by Pre Sales. Ian Merry is involved with this system.
•
Calendy: Managed by Ed Sharp, likely for scheduling meetings.
•
Linksquares: Links emails across Sales and Legal systems, integrating with Salesforce.
•
Hubspot: Used for marketing automation, particularly for capturing website leads (though none in NA/EMEA in the last 3 years according to one source). Administered sometimes for acquisitions that use it. Email logging via Outlook plugin is the correct method.
•
Gearset: A code comparison tool used for managing code and deployments to orgs, sandboxes, and code repositories. CI (Continuous Integration) is managed via Gearset. Manual deployment procedure involves logging into Gearset, comparing source and target orgs, selecting changes, and validating/deploying.
•
Bitbucket: Used for code storage in version control (ideagendevelopment/SAL). VS Code is used to interact with the Bitbucket repository for development.
•
Klient: Likely a Professional Services Automation (PSA) tool, used in the old Salesforce org. User setup involves adding users to both the old and new Salesforce orgs and setting up a Project Resource record in Klient.
•
CORUSON: A ticketing system used by the SOP team to manage their workload, including requests for credit memos or invoice amendments. Users raise tickets here detailing the required changes and impacted subscriptions/products.
•
AvaTax: Mentioned in migration tasks for setting up legal entities. Jake is involved in this.
•
Netsuite: Mentioned in migration tasks related to Matt Southgate and Netsuite IDs in Zuora workflows, and Damien being involved in Netsuite testing. Likely an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system.
•
Docusign: Used for signing documentation, such as quotes/order forms. The button appears on the Quote page when the opportunity stage is Negotiate & Close. Users can use automatically generated templates or upload their own documents. User setup requires assigning the Docusign User permission set in Salesforce and adding the user in the Docusign Apps Launcher management section.
•
Snaplogic: An integration platform used for migrating data between systems. Konstantin Lalov should be notified of field changes on specific objects integrated via Snaplogic.
•
Rollup Helper: A tool used in Salesforce to calculate values by rolling up data from related records, specifically mentioned for calculating various ABC values on Opportunities.
•
VS Code: A code editor used with Bitbucket for Salesforce development.
Sales Processes
Our sales processes cover the full lifecycle from lead generation to closing deals and managing customer relationships. We handle different scenarios, including New Logos, Mid-term Adjustments (MTAs), and Renewals.
Sales Methodology and Stages:
We align sales activities to the buyer's journey (Awareness, Interest, Consideration, Purchase, Loyalty, Advocate). Our sales process maps to distinct stages, often tracked in Salesforce and previously in Hubspot (for CompliSpace) or other CRMs. The stages guide salespeople on necessary activities.
•
Stage 0: Introduction / Above the Funnel: This is the initial business development activity focused on prospecting and generating interest. Activities include digital marketing, BDR (Business Development Representative) outreach, working with alliance partners, analysts, and the customer success team, handling referrals, and targeting specific accounts. Tools like ZoomInfo are used to find target accounts and personas based on criteria like industry (mining, construction), employee count, revenue, and location. Intent data from ZoomInfo helps identify potential buyers researching relevant topics. SalesLoft (migrating to Outreach) is used to execute multi-touch campaigns (emails, calls, LinkedIn invites) and track engagement. The goal is to "Be Compelling" and "Get Meeting" (Stage 0 Meeting). This stage does not involve significant qualification beyond initial interest, as the approach is to identify potential fit based on industry and size. The outcome is scheduling a next meeting.
•
Stage 1: Qualify: The potential customer expresses interest and agrees to a follow-up meeting. Activities include initial intro presentations ("Level 1 Pitch"), sharing industry-specific content, use case examples, ROI examples, and potentially screenshots. The focus is on understanding the organization and decision-makers. There's less emphasis on deep qualification early on, especially if the prospect is in a target industry (like mining or construction) and fits the ideal customer profile, as they are viewed as "pre-qualified" due to likely use of manual processes. The goal is to understand pain points and confirm value outcomes. The transition from Stage 0 to Stage 1 is having a next meeting in place.
•
Stage 2: Discovery / Diagnose: This stage involves a deeper dive into the customer's needs and processes. Activities include requirements gathering, SME (Subject Matter Expert) interviews, value discovery, capturing detailed customer information, prioritizing use cases, and agreeing on business improvement areas and success criteria. This aligns with Ideagen's "Discover and Diagnose" methodology. The goal is to understand the customer's current state ("as is") and desired future state ("to be"). Identifying and securing a champion within the customer organization is also key here.
•
Stage 3: Developing (Socialization & Buy In) / Evaluation, Proof, Decision: The focus shifts to presenting the solution and building internal consensus within the customer's organization. Activities may include custom demos or workshops, customer reference calls or visits, and presenting value propositions. The goal is for the proposed solution to reach the shortlist or selection phase.
•
Stage 4: Proposal / Propose Solution: A formal proposal or quote is generated and shared with the customer. In our process, this involves creating a Quote in Salesforce (covered in detail below). The opportunity stage moves to Propose Solution, and the win probability automatically updates to Upside.
•
Stage 5: Contracts / Validate Solution, Preferred Vendor, Negotiate & Close: This final stage involves negotiation, contract review, and securing signatures. The opportunity stage moves to Validate Solution (win probability Upside), then Preferred Vendor (win probability Commit), and finally Negotiate & Close (win probability Commit). Docusign is used for electronic signatures. Once terms are agreed and the order form signed, the SOP team is involved in reviewing the opportunity and quote before sending it to Zuora.
•
Closed Won: The deal is successfully closed. The SOP team sends the quote to Zuora.
•
Closed Lost / Killed: The deal is lost for any reason or abandoned. There is a process for closing opportunities as lost or killed.
The MEDDPICC framework (Metrics, Economic Buyer, Decision Criteria, Decision Process, Paper Process, Implicated Pain, Champion, Competition) is used in managing opportunities, representing Ideagen's sales methodology. Salespeople are expected to fill out these fields, particularly focusing on Paper Process (documentation needed and time) and Implicated Pain (what drives the customer to change).
Creating and Managing Opportunities (New Logo Scenario):
1.
Create Opportunity: Opportunities are created from a Contact record in Salesforce. You select "New Subscription Opportunity" from the contact dropdown.
2.
Input Required Details: Key fields to fill include Opportunity Name (often your name for initial creation), Close Date, Stage (always Discover initially), Opportunity Currency (AUD is mentioned in one example, but should be relevant to the deal), Business Unit (CompliSpace is mentioned in an example), Initial Product of Interest, Type (New Logo for new customers), Opportunity Source and Source Type, and Term (in Months, 24 months is mentioned as standard). For New Logos, ensure the Type field is set correctly.
3.
Navigate to Opportunity: After creation, navigate to the opportunity record, typically via a link or by finding it under the Account's quick links.
4.
Add Placeholder Product: Add a placeholder product from the Products related list to give the opportunity an indicative value for pipeline reporting.
5.
Record Activity: Log notes, events, and tasks in the Activities tab.
6.
Manage Stage: Update the opportunity stage as the deal progresses (e.g., Diagnose during discovery calls, Propose Solution when performing demos).
7.
Fill MEDDPICC Fields: Complete the MEDDPICC fields, focusing on Paper Process and Implicated Pain.
8.
Create Quote: When ready to share pricing, create a Quote from the opportunity dropdown ("New Quote").
9.
Delete Placeholder Product: Crucially, delete the placeholder product before creating the quote to avoid duplication of value.
10.
Select Billing Account: For existing customers, select New or Existing Billing Account. For new customers, you go directly to the quote details page.
11.
Fill Quote Details: Populate mandatory and important fields on the quote details page. These include Valid Until date, Is this a non-standard SOW? (triggers legal review), Primary (only one primary quote per opportunity, triggers Opportunity Products creation), Quote Business Type (always 'New' for New Logo), Is PO required?, Contract terms, Sales Rep, Start Date (subscription start and invoice date), and Initial Term (subscription length in months). If setting up a New Billing Account, also provide Bill to Contact, Sold to Contact, Payment Method, Payment Term, Currency, and Legal Entity. Non-mandatory but important fields include Quote Template (select relevant template) and Legal Entity.
12.
Add Products via Guided Selling Flow: Use the Guided Selling Flow to add Licenses, Implementation Products, and Additional Products to the quote.
13.
Review and Save Quote: Review the selected products, quantities, and pricing. Edit quantity or total fields if needed. Click Save or navigate through the flow stages (Next, Back).
14.
Submit Quote for Approval: When the customer is happy and the opportunity stage is Preferred Vendor, submit the quote for SOP review. Go to the Quote page and click "Submit for Approval", adding comments if necessary.
15.
Add Order Form: Before SOP approval, add an order form by either generating a systemized PDF/Word document from the quote details page or uploading your own documentation to the Notes & Attachments related list.
16.
SOP Review: The SOP team (in India) reviews the quote and opportunity, checking for required documentation (order form) and ensuring quote/opportunity values match. They also check for required approval notes for discounts. Quotes submitted before 4 pm Sydney time are typically approved/rejected the same day.
17.
Legal Review: If the quote includes a non-standard SOW or terms, Legal team approval is required before SOP can approve. Key legal contacts are provided.
18.
Sign with Docusign: Once approved (Opportunity stage Negotiate & Close), sign the quote/order form using Docusign, accessed via a button on the Quote page. Send the document to the customer via Docusign.
19.
Close Win Opportunity: Once the order form is signed, change the opportunity stage to Closed Won.
20.
SOP Send to Zuora: The SOP team verifies the signed order form and matches details (amount, billing/shipping address, frequency, contact) against the quote and opportunity. If everything matches, they send the quote to Zuora. Any deviations lead to a SOP query and hold the quote. Sending to Zuora activates the subscription and triggers invoicing. A subscription record is created in Salesforce.
21.
Operational Team Notification: Specified members of the Operational Team are notified via email when mid-term adjustment or new business opportunities are closed won.
Mid-term Adjustment (MTA) Scenario:
This process is similar to New Logo but for existing customers modifying their subscription (adding licenses/products, etc.).
1.
Create Opportunity: Create the opportunity from a Contact record.
2.
Input Required Details: Fill required details. Type will be Customer (for existing customers). Opportunity Source Type will be Addition (inbound, <20 volume) or Upsell (outbound, >=20 volume).
3.
Manage Stage: Manage the opportunity stage (Diagnose during discovery, Present solution during demos).
4.
Fill MEDDPICC Fields: Fill out MEDDPICC fields, though the expectation might be less than for a new logo due to shorter sales cycles.
5.
Add Placeholder Product: Add a placeholder product for pipeline value.
6.
Create Quote: When ready, create a Quote.
7.
Delete Placeholder Product: Delete the placeholder product before creating the quote.
8.
Select Existing Billing Account: For MTAs, you will select an Existing Billing Account.
9.
Select Quote Type: Select Renew/Amend Quote Flow and then Add Licences.
10.
Add Products via Guided Selling Flow: Add licenses, implementation products, and additional products using the Guided Selling Flow.
11.
Submit Quote for Approval: Same process as New Logo. Opportunity stage Preferred Vendor.
12.
Add Order Form: Same process as New Logo.
13.
SOP/Legal Review: Same process as New Logo.
14.
Sign with Docusign: Same process as New Logo. Opportunity stage Negotiate & Close.
15.
Close Win Opportunity: Same process as New Logo.
16.
SOP Send to Zuora: SOP sends the quote to Zuora. This activates the amendments to the existing subscription and triggers invoicing for adjusted amounts.
17.
Operational Team Notification: Specified members of the Operational Team are notified via email when mid-term adjustment opportunities are closed won.
Renewal Scenario:
This process covers renewing existing customer subscriptions.
1.
Monitor Upcoming Renewals: Customer Teams use reports in Salesforce to monitor upcoming renewals, grouped by close date, and perform quarterly check-ins.
2.
Navigate to Renewal Opportunity: Access the renewal opportunity from reports or the original subscription record's opportunities section.
3.
Price Agreed?
◦
Yes (Happy Path): If the price is agreed with the customer, the Customer Team hands the opportunity over to the Finance Team. This is done by changing the opportunity owner in Salesforce and sending a notification email.
◦
No (Comeback Trail): If the price is not agreed, the opportunity might enter a dispute process. If resolved within 50 days, the opportunity is re-configured (details not specified on how in the sources). A reminder email may be sent.
4.
Verify Opportunity Details: The Finance team verifies opportunity details.
5.
Create Quote and Adjust Pricing: The Finance team creates the renewal quote (or adjusts pricing on an existing one?). Most quote details pull from the previous subscription. Key fields to configure: Primary (required for approval), Quote Business Type ('Renewal'), Quote Template (select relevant one), Term length (typically 12 months). Products from the original subscription appear after submitting quote details. The CPI uplift process (detailed below) is relevant here for adjusting prices.
6.
Close Win the Renewal: Once the quote is agreed, the Finance team closes the opportunity as Closed Won.
7.
Send to Zuora: The SOP team sends the renewal quote to Zuora to activate the renewed subscription and trigger invoicing.
8.
Operational Team Notification: Specified members of the Operational Team (a different list than for New Logo/MTA) are notified via email when renewal opportunities are closed won, specifically Aileen Lin and Rachel Partis.
Ramp Quote Scenario:
Ramp quotes allow for changes in quantity, price, or products year-by-year within a multi-year subscription.
1.
Create Quote: Handled similarly to New Logo, but a specific field on the quote details page must be selected to make it a ramp quote (field name not explicitly stated, but functionality is tied to the quote creation process).
2.
Add Products: Add products via the guided selling flow. When adding products, you can specify the year they are added (e.g., adding licenses to Year 2 of a 2-year ramp).
3.
Specify Quantities/Prices by Year: After adding products, specify quantities and edit prices year-by-year. Adding to Year 1 automatically adds to subsequent years, which can then be adjusted.
4.
Submit Quote: Submit the ramp quote once finished.
5.
Opportunity Product Creation: On the opportunity, only one product record will be created for each distinct product added to the quote, with values added together across the years.
6.
Amend Ramp Quote: Existing ramp quotes can be edited by selecting the dropdown on the quote page. The Start Date field on an amendment indicates when the change is active from.
Finance and Operations Processes
The Finance and Operations teams handle critical downstream processes related to billing, revenue, and customer support.
•
CPI Uplift Manual Workaround: This is a current manual process to apply Consumer Price Index (CPI) uplifts to multi-year subscriptions on their anniversary dates to account for inflation. A semi-automated solution is expected to go live soon.
1.
Finance Request: The Finance team emails the SOP team (orders.in@ideagen.com) requesting a list of active, multi-year subscriptions and products requiring CPI uplift scheduling in the next 90 days, using a specific template.
2.
SOP Run Query: The SOP team identifies relevant subscriptions/products and emails back a CSV list with necessary data fields.
3.
Finance Confirm: The Finance team confirms the list is correct and emails the SOP team to confirm readiness to schedule uplifts and specify the percentage increase. They also inform SOP of any issues or subscriptions to exclude.
4.
SOP Manually Schedule Uplifts: The SOP team manually schedules the CPI uplifts.
5.
SOP Update Data: The SOP team manually updates relevant service and renewal data for impacted subscriptions. Key changes include updating the subscription's 'version' field (e.g., from 1 to 2) and the 'value' field to reflect price/quantity changes.
6.
SOP Send Confirmation: The SOP team sends confirmation of the scheduled uplifts.
•
Invoicing Questions:
◦
If a customer has NOT been sent an invoice yet, send queries to orders.in@ideagen.com, referencing the account number. The SOP team handles these queries.
◦
If a customer HAS been sent an invoice, send queries to Customer.Invoices@Ideagen.com, referencing the invoice number. The SOP team also handles these queries.
•
Reversing / Amending Invoices (Credit Memo Request): This process is initiated via a ticket in CORUSON.
1.
Customer Cancellation: If a customer wants to cancel a renewal completely, they reach out to cancel.
2.
Raise Ticket in CORUSON: Finance team raises a ticket in CORUSON (https://ideagenqa.gaelenlighten.com/Home/Workspace#!/home) using the 'Credit Memo Request' icon. The ticket should detail impacted subscription/products, required changes, customer communication, and other relevant info.
3.
SOP Cancel Subscription: The SOP team cancels the subscription.
4.
SOP Issue Credit Memo: The SOP team issues a customer credit memo.
5.
Finance Close Lose Opportunity: The Finance team closes the relevant renewal opportunity as Closed Lost.
◦
Scenario for Amendment: If the customer wants to amend a subscription/invoice rather than cancel, the process might differ slightly after raising the CORUSON ticket (e.g., SOP amends the subscription in Zuora, informs Finance, and Finance updates the renewal opportunity).
◦
Credit notes are viewed cautiously as "cash out the door". It's important to understand the rationale behind a credit request and attach adequate backups for faster processing.
•
Managing Service and Operational Data: Legacy system service data is being recreated and made visible in Salesforce, split into Service data and Operational data, visible on account records. The full solution for managing this data is under development.
◦
Service Data: Includes fields like CompliSpace Service ID, Name, Subscription Date, Book Value, Project, Details, Code, Industry Rate Code, Rate Card Code, Product Description, End Date, and Service Status. Edit access is restricted to Aileen Lin and Stephanie Ward.
◦
Operational Data: Includes fields like CompliSpace Parent Name, Top Level Parent, Customer Segment, Industry Segment, Number of Policy Users, Assurance Users, Learning Users, URLs (PolicyPlus, Assurance Production, Assurance Sandbox, CompliLearn Portal, CompliLearn App, Go1, PlanCheckGo Sandbox/Live, SafeTripBuilder Sandbox/Live, User Directory), PP&A Initiation/Renewal Cycle Start, Learning List Initiation/Renewal Cycle Start, HUBSPOT ID, Subscription Notes, Student Numbers, Solution, Platform, Content, Premium, CompliLearn Learning Lists, Operational Jurisdiction(s), PolicyConnect/CSP URL, School Sectors, ACARA SML, Care Type, Religious Affiliation. Edit access is restricted to Georgina McQuade, Nicola Inglis, Poornima Chittiraju, Smriti Suman, Aileen Lin, and Stephanie Ward.
•
Credit Control Activities: The CC Team focuses on collection follow-up, managing items in query, credit notes, and handling mailboxes. Query types tracked include Agreed Payment Plan, Awaiting Credit Note, Credit Control Admin, Customer Legal Review, Delivery Query, Ideagen Legal Review, Incorrect Invoicing, PO Issue, Portal Issues, Pricing Query, Product Query, Refer to DCA (Debt Collection Agency?), and Renewal Dispute. Portal Inbox monitoring and tracking is crucial, as failure to do so was impacting significant revenue (£2 million GBP).
Systems Development Practices
Our development team follows specific standards and practices, particularly for Salesforce.
•
Salesforce Naming Conventions:
◦
Objects: Nouns, singular, start with a capital letter. API names may contain underscores and end with "__c".
◦
Fields: Must be descriptive and concise. Descriptions should be added to both objects and custom fields.
•
Salesforce Coding Standards (Apex):
◦
Similar to Java, not case-sensitive but consistent casing is good practice.
◦
Methods should be short, ideally not exceeding 80 lines. Adhere to the "Single Responsibility" principle (each class/method has one purpose/reason to change).
◦
Follow DRY ("Don't Repeat Yourself") principle.
◦
Avoid DML (Data Manipulation Language) or SOQL (Salesforce Object Query Language) queries within loops to prevent hitting governor limits.
◦
Avoid hardcoded values in classes or flows; use custom labels or settings.
◦
Comments should explain why code was written a certain way, not how or what it does.
◦
Use break, continue, and return statements to limit nesting.
◦
Ensure all SOQL queries have selective filters to avoid performance issues and exceptions.
•
Salesforce Triggers:
◦
Only one trigger per object is allowed.
◦
Triggers should be logicless, calling a trigger handler class for execution.
◦
All triggers must have a switch (driven by custom settings/metadata) to turn them off during bulk data loads.
•
Formatting: Consistent formatting and indentation are required (4 spaces for Apex, 2 spaces for frontend code like Javascript/HTML). Line length should not exceed 150 characters for readability.
•
Testing: All Apex code must have at least 90% code coverage with tests covering positive/negative outcomes, null/invalid parameters, permissions, bulk data (for triggers), and ensuring all tests pass.
•
Version Control and Commits: Code is committed to a version control system (Bitbucket). Commit messages must explain the why of the code change.
•
Deployments: Managed via Gearset, a comparison tool for deploying code and metadata between orgs and repositories. CI is managed here.
Project and Migration Context
The sources reference ongoing projects, including a significant Australian Migration and the integration of acquired businesses like Damstra Technology.
•
Australian Migration: A project involving system changes (RevOps & Finance, Customer Systems) and marketing updates (website, paid media, Pardot). Key phases include Discovery Workshops, Design, Development, QA, UAT (User Acceptance Testing), Training (including Train the Trainer), and Go-Live. System readiness and gap sign-offs are tracked.
•
Damstra Integration: This involves integrating Damstra's processes (like their sales methodology and tools) and systems (like their Salesforce record type, SalesLoft, ZoomInfo) into the core Ideagen environment. This requires migrating data, setting up users in Ideagen systems (Outreach, Clari, Gainsight, etc.), and ensuring functionality (like ZoomInfo intent topics) is preserved or enhanced. Brice Elliott's team is a focus of this integration work.
•
Pipeline Migrations Project: Specific objects (Account, Contact, Opportunity, Opportunity Products, Acquisition Pipeline Error Logs) and picklists are involved, requiring coordination with specific personnel (Konstantin Lalov, Svetlana Ford) when fields or picklist values change.
Ways of Working
•
Meetings: Team stand-ups are held three times weekly in the mornings. Quick questions can be handled via Teams messages or calls. Specific meetings with stakeholders should be booked with an agenda. Recurring meetings strategy should involve Tom Vickers or Laura McKay. Weekly 1-2-1 meetings are also a practice.
•
Prioritization: Projects are received and prioritized via input from Damien Ford, Tom Vickers, Laura McKay, other business stakeholders, and key stakeholder requests. Requests are added to a backlog. Priorities are assessed weekly, capacity is assessed, and projects are assigned to Business Analysts. Projects are planned with Project Manager resources if needed. BAU (Business As Usual) tasks for Ideagen and BAs are also managed. Support tickets are raised and escalated via front-line support.
•
Business Analyst Specifics: Business Analysts use the BA Jira board to manage their priorities and tasks. Lucid is used for process documentation. SharePoint for file storage. Teams/Outlook for comms and meetings. Jira for project/development management.
